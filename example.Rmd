## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(greta)
x <- iris$Petal.Length
y <- iris$Sepal.Length
plot(x,y)

int <- normal(0, 5)
coef <- normal(0, 3)
sd <- lognormal(0, 3)

mean <- int + coef * x
distribution(y) <- normal(mean, sd)
m <- model(int, coef, sd)
plot(m)
draws <- mcmc(m, n_samples = 1000, chains = 3)
bayesplot::mcmc_trace(draws)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
