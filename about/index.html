<p>At simplRstats, we offer statistical consultancy and tailored in-house statistics courses for Undergraduates and Postgraduates in the R programming language.

Our aim is to provide all course attendees with a solid foundation in statistics, introducing participants to coding in R, and the steps involved in visualising, analysing and presenting data for scientific publications. 

Each course we deliver comprises of a carefully thought out combination of lectures, group work and hands-on practicals to ensure all participants leave with the confidence to perform independent analyses.</p>
